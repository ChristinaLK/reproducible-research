##Notes - Version control with github

I've already done a lot of stuff with git/github, so I don't have many notes for this.  

My favorite resources for learning/using git are:
* http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/
* https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1

I have done a workshop on how to collaborate using git/github:
* https://github.com/ChristinaLK/githubIsFun

And just for fun, 
* http://starlogs.net

This is what happens if you put this repository into starlogs:
